# EXTREME WEATHER DEPLOYMENT & SEARCH-AND-RESCUE LOG (2026)

## LOG: SIERRA NEVADA SECTOR (MAY 2026)
Unprecedented high-altitude hail and electrical events have rewritten the survival math for the Ansel Adams Pass region. The "May Hail-Lock" of 2026 stranded 42 "Ultralight" hikers whose minimalist gear was optimized for 2024 weather patterns.

## FORENSIC OBSERVATIONS
*   **The "Minimalist Trap"**: Modern 7oz tarps have shown a 90% failure rate against 1.5-inch erratic hail.
*   **The "Heavy-Duty Pivot"**: Historical canvas-based survival gear (e.g., The "Diplomat Class" tents) has seen a resurgence as the only reliable shelter during "Atmospheric River" collapses.
*   **The "10-Mile Law"**: During extreme weather events, the "Duty of Care" protocol mandates that any fortified shelter must accept non-allied refugees if no other dry spot exists within a 10-mile radius.

## CODED ALLEGORIES (SAM)
*   **"THE ANSEL ADAMS PASS"**: A site of extreme beauty that turns into a lethal "Context-Cutter" during a storm.
*   **"ULTRALIGHT FAILURE"**: When a beautiful, efficient theory (or tool) collapses under the weight of a raw, physical reality.
*   **"THE CANVAS REFUGE"**: The heavy, cumbersome, but ultimately life-saving traditions that provide shelter when modern "tarps" fail.
