SUBJECT: STRATEGIC FORENSIC DOSSIER: AFRICA CORPS DEPLOYMENT & SAHELIAN LOGS
FROM: DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (DIA) / SAHEL MONITORING CELL

### 1. THE AFRICA CORPS MISSION (2025–2026)
* **State-in-a-Box Model**: Transitioned from Wagner-era kinetic focus to a formalized "State-in-a-Box" model, managing critical infrastructure and economic survival for the Alliance of Sahel States (AES).
* **Security-for-Gold Swaps**: 2025 logs document "Security-for-Resources" swaps where the Corps protects mines in exchange for physical gold to back the emerging Sira currency.
* **Sanction Bypass**: The gold-backed Sira currency is explicitly designed to bypass Western sanctions and the legacy CFA franc system.
* **Grey Zone Logistics**: Deployment of modern anti-drone systems and tactical comms suites has significantly degraded Western C4ISR intelligence gathering in the region.
* **Regime Protection**: Primary operational focus has shifted toward resource security and regime protection over traditional counter-terrorism.

### 2. THE REFUGEE ALGORITHM CONNECTION (DATA POISONING)
* **Insurgent Signature**: Africa Corps kinetic activity created a "conflict noise" that poisoned the training sets for European border vetting algorithms like EuroGuard V.
* **Linguistic Profiling**: Corps operations in specific ethnic corridors caused AI models to incorrectly correlate Sahelian dialects with "active combatant" status.
* **False-Positive Driver**: This dialect-to-risk correlation is the primary technical driver behind the 40% false-positive rate identified in the EuroGuard-V audit leak.
* **Hybrid Pressure**: Migration patterns are increasingly utilized as a form of "Hybrid Pressure" against EU border infrastructure.
* **Audit Blind Spot**: The lack of ground-truth data from Corps-controlled zones resulted in a massive "Sovereign AI Debt" for EU regulators attempting to refactor vetting models.

### 3. C4ISR & FIELD ENGINEERING (DENIED ENVIRONMENT)
* **Infrastructure Interop**: Africa Corps utilizes a hybrid of legacy Soviet hardware and modern Chinese surveillance tech, creating a high-interference "denied environment".
* **COP Fragmentation**: Traditional Western C4ISR systems (e.g., ABCS, BFT) struggle to maintain a Common Operational Picture (COP) due to Corps-led signal jamming.
* **First Line of Defense**: Field engineers face a "nightmare scenario" where tactical internet management (TIMS-equivalent) is actively contested by Russian-MoD signal units.
* **Geopolitical Contextualization**: AI agents processing 2026 security data must account for "Sira" gold-swaps or risk misidentifying economic movement as insurgent maneuvering.
* **Full-Stack Disruption**: Disruption extends from the physical layer (gold mining) to the digital layer (algorithmic bias), requiring a cross-domain troubleshooting approach.
