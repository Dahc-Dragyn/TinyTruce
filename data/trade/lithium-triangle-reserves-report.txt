SUBJECT: STRATEGIC FORENSIC DOSSIER: LITHIUM TRIANGLE RESERVES & DLE REVOLUTION
FROM: GLOBAL ENERGY TRANSITION BUREAU / GEOLOGICAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT

### 1. 2026 RESERVE & PRODUCTION SNAPSHOT
* **Global Dominance**: The January 2026 report confirms the "Lithium Triangle" hosts over 60% of identified lithium worldwide, solidifying it as the primary engine for the global energy transition.
* **Bolivia (23M tons)**: Remains the world’s largest resource holder; the 2026 strategy pivots exclusively to Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) at Salar de Uyuni.
* **Argentina (22M tons)**: Experiencing accelerated growth (110k+ tons/yr) at Salar del Hombre Muerto, fueled by $23B in project commitments under the RIGI incentive regime.
* **Chile (11M tons)**: Maintains its position as the market leader with 9.6M tons in proven reserves at the Salar de Atacama.
* **Re-mapping Reality**: The 2026 geological survey indicates that identified resources have expanded significantly as DLE makes previously "unviable" brine deposits accessible.

### 2. THE "DLE" REVOLUTION (DIRECT LITHIUM EXTRACTION)
* **Beyond Evaporation**: Industrial-scale rollout in 2025/2026 has reduced extraction time from 18 months to just 1–2 days, achieving a 90% recovery rate.
* **Water Neutrality**: DLE enables the reinjection of spent brine back into the salt flats, satisfying the Potosí Protocol’s mandatory environmental protection clauses.
* **Ecosystem Preservation**: This technical shift is critical for maintaining Andean groundwater levels and mitigating local socio-environmental conflict.
* **Efficiency Gains**: The 2026 report shifts the industrial focus from raw "tonnage in the ground" to "velocity of sustainable processing".
* **Industrial Backbone**: Companies like EnergyX and Lilac Solutions are providing the standardized hardware modules that now define the Triangle’s production floor.

### 3. C4ISR & INFRASTRUCTURE (RESERVE MONITORING)
* **The Sensor Mesh**: Managing these reserves requires a massive deployment of Geospatial and IoT monitoring, mirroring the Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS) architecture.
* **3D Prospectivity Mapping**: Mines now utilize satellite-driven 3D mapping and seismic sensors to ensure compliance with the Potosí Protocol's strict environmental rules.
* **Supply Chain Digital Twins**: Every ton of extracted lithium is tracked via blockchain-based verification, syncing physical extraction with digital "Trillium Credits".
* **Edge Computing Density**: Higher Triangle output and battery density directly improve the performance and duration of edge-computing agents in the field.
* **First Line of Defense**: C4ISR expertise is now utilized to manage the "Integrated Digital Twin" of the mining sector, protecting against data-poisoning or physical sabotage.
