# 5G/6G SPECTRUM COMPLIANCE STANDARD (2025 REVISION)

## OVERVIEW
The rollout of high-frequency mmWave (millimeter wave) infrastructure has faced unprecedented public resistance in urban centers. The 2025 Compliance Standard (CS-2025) was drafted to address "Bio-Electromagnetic Friction" through a combination of engineering limits and mandatory public transparency.

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
*   **Distance Mandates**: Base stations operating >30GHz must maintain a minimum "Buffer Zone" of 50 feet from schools, playgrounds, and healthcare facilities.
*   **Emission Thresholds**: Power-density must not exceed 0.05 mW/cm² in public residential zones, a level previously considered "Hyper-Conservative."
*   **The "Audit-Drop" Protocol**: In cases of public dispute, a neutral third-party validator (e.g., The IEEE Bio-Safety Board) can perform an unannounced, real-time emission audit.

## SOCIO-POLITICAL IMPACT
*   **Vancouver Hearings (2025)**: A landmark case where a "Citizen-Science" collective used private BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) readings to claim local interference, forcing a 4-month construction delay.
*   **The "Spectrum Neutrality" Clause**: Ensures that private data streams cannot be prioritized over public emergency signals within the same frequency band.

## CODED ALLEGORIES (SAM)
*   **"THE BUFFER ZONE"**: The fragile physical space between technological progress and human safety.
*   **"SPECTRUM DRIFT"**: When technology expands beyond its legal or safe boundaries.
*   **"THE NEUTRAL AUDIT"**: The intervention of objective truth in a subjective emotional debate.
