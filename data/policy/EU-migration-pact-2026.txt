DATE: February 19, 2026
SUBJECT: STRATEGIC FORENSIC DOSSIER: EU MIGRATION PACT "GO-LIVE" (JUNE 2026)
FROM: EU HOME AFFAIRS / BORDER ARCHITECTURE & SOLIDARITY CELL

### THE JUNE 12, 2026 "GO-LIVE" (FULL APPLICABILITY)
1. The Final Deadline: Per the May 2024 adoption, June 12, 2026 marks the mandatory implementation date for all nine regulations and the primary directive across all 27 Member States.
2. Mandatory Solidarity Pool (2026): The Council formally adopted the first Annual Solidarity Pool on Dec 19, 2025. It targets 30,000 relocations or €600M in financial contributions for the 2026 cycle.
3. The €20,000 "Opt-Out": States refusing their relocation quota must pay €20,000 per person into the EU Solidarity Fund or provide equivalent "Operational Support" (C4ISR hardware/staff).
4. Crisis Regulation: New 2026 rules allow Member States to temporarily suspend regular asylum procedures during "Massive Influx" events or "Instrumentalization" (state-sponsored migration) attacks.
5. National Implementation Plans (NIPs): As of February 2026, all Member States have finalized their NIPs, detailing the physical expansion of border detention and screening infrastructure.

### EURODAC 2.0 & THE DIGITAL THREAD (THE INFRASTRUCTURE)
6. Biometric Age Shift: As of June 2026, the mandatory age for fingerprint and facial image collection has been lowered from 14 to 6 years old to create a "lifetime digital thread."
7. Tracking Persons, Not Claims: Eurodac 2.0 has transitioned from a database of "applications" to a database of "individuals," allowing for real-time tracking of unauthorized secondary movements.
8. Integrated Screening: Irregular arrivals now undergo a mandatory 7-day screening involving health, security, and biometric checks, with data automatically cross-referenced against SIS, VIS, and EES.
9. Facial Image Dominance: 2026 hardware upgrades at borders now prioritize high-fidelity facial biometrics over traditional fingerprints to facilitate "Frictionless Identification."
10. The 20% Vetting Threshold: Applicants from nations with a <20% EU-wide asylum recognition rate are now automatically funneled into "Accelerated Border Procedures."

### OFFSHORE HUB & RETURN STRATEGY
11. The "Return Hub" Model: Following the 2025 Italy-Albania pilot, the EU has officially sanctioned "Offshore Return Hubs" in third countries for processing rejected applicants.
12. Safe Third Country List (2026): A unified EU list has been finalized, allowing for immediate deportation to "Transit Countries" (e.g., Tunisia, Albania, or Uganda) even if the applicant has no prior link there.
13. The 12-Week Deadline: Border procedures must be completed within 12 weeks (84 days). If no decision is reached, the applicant must be granted entry, creating a "Technical Ticking Clock."
14. Automatic Return Orders: As of June 2026, a rejection of an asylum claim automatically generates an EU-wide Return Order, enforceable by all Member States via the new Return Warrant system.
15. The "Solidarity Ledger": A real-time ML-driven dashboard tracks Member State contributions (cash vs. humans) to ensure the 2026 "Fair Share" metrics are met.
