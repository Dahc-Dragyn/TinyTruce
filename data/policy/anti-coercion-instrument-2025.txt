DATE: December 12, 2025
SUBJECT: STRATEGIC POLICY DOSSIER: THE EU ANTI-COERCION INSTRUMENT (ACI)
FROM: EUROPEAN COMMISSION / DG TRADE / UNIT G.1 (TRADE DEFENCE)

### THE ANTI-COERCION MANDATE (ACI 2025)
1. Operational Readiness: As of October 2025, the Anti-Coercion Instrument (Regulation EU 2023/2675) is fully operational. It allows the EU to respond to foreign economic coercion—defined as the "Instrumentalization" of trade to force a sovereign political pivot.
2. The "Raw Power" Trigger: Brussels has formally designated the US Section 122 universal 20% tariff as a "Primary Act of Coercion." This triggers the ACI's consultative and retaliatory framework.
3. The Retaliation Bazooka: Under the 2026 "Brussels Effect" protocol, the EU is authorized to respond with targeted tariffs on up to €120B of US-origin automotive, chemical, and luxury goods.

### DIPLOMATIC REDLINES & SECURITY BRIDGES
4. Automotive/Chemical Focal Point: The US tariff on German automotive exports and Dutch chemical exports is viewed as an "Existential Regulatory Threat." The ACI enables the EU to suspend intellectual property protections for US-owned patents in these sectors.
5. The NATO security decoupling: The 2026 "Strategic Pause" in NATO cooperation is being used as a counter-lever. The EU is currently evaluating the "Security-for-Trade" bypass, offering US firms access to the internal market in exchange for decentralized nuclear sharing participation.
6. The Berlaymont Protocol: Any agreement reached in the Brussels Berlaymont Crisis Room must be backed by a "Model-Verified" de-escalation scorecard.

### C4ISR & TRADE DEFENCE INFRASTRUCTURE
7. Logic-Audit of Tariffs: The EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) is utilizing AI-driven "Trade Flow Monitors" to identify US firms most vulnerable to ACI de-certification.
8. Sovereign Data Integrity: Retaliatory measures include the "Geofencing" of US Cloud providers from EU industrial data if Section 122 tariffs are not frozen within 60 days.
9. "Brussels Effect" 2.0 Enforcement: The EU is coordinating with the "Emerging Compute Nations" (Kenya, Brazil) to apply mutual ACI standards against US "Data Colonialism."
