FROM: DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (DIA) / CONFLICT OSINT CELL

### FRONTLINE STATUS (GIS & MANEUVER)
1. Russian forces have advanced to within 5.0 kilometers (3.1 miles) of the T0504 highway, the primary logistical artery for the Pokrovsk-Myrnohrad agglomeration. 
2. The operational encirclement of Myrnohrad is 65% complete, with Russian fire control established over all northern egress routes. 
3. Russian advance rate in the Pokrovsk sector averaged 220 meters per day in January 2026.
4. The "Grey Zone" between lines in this sector has shrunk to less than 400 meters, effectively negating medical evacuation windows.
5. Ukraine’s 7th Rapid Response Corps has deployed 4,000 anti-tank mines along the Hryshyne axis in the last 72 hours to stall the northern pincer. 
6. Ukraine retains a consolidated foothold of 4.2 square miles (approx. 11 sq km) in the Belgorod border region as of Feb 10, 2026. 
7. This zone serves as a launch vector for Short-Range Ballistic Missile (SRBM) strikes, reducing flight time to Russian logistical hubs by 40%.
8. Russian "Sever" Grouping has failed to liquidate this pocket despite eight mechanized assaults in January 2026.
9. The foothold is supplied exclusively via heavy-lift drone bridges, as ground Lines of Communication (LOCs) are severed.
10. Ukraine has constructed three subterranean command nodes within this pocket to withstand FAB-3000 glide bomb strikes.
11. The "Zap-Wall" fortification network now spans 140 kilometers in depth, from Orikhiv to the Dnieper River.
12. Concrete density in the primary defensive belt has reached 2.5 bunkers per square kilometer.
13. Russian preparations for a Summer 2026 Offensive in Zaporizhzhia have been detected via satellite imagery of equipment staging in Melitopol. 
14. The "Surovikin Line" (Russian defense) and "Zap-Wall" (Ukrainian defense) are now separated by a static minefield belt averaging 3km wide.
15. No mechanized breakthroughs have occurred in the Zaporizhzhia sector for 14 consecutive months.
16. Russia currently occupies 18.4% of Ukrainian territory (approx. 45,835 sq miles), including pre-2022 holdings. 
17. From Jan 13 to Feb 10, 2026, Russia seized a net total of 182 square miles, largely consisting of open fields in Donetsk. 
18. Ukraine recaptured 12 square miles in the Kharkiv sector during localized counter-attacks in early February.
19. The frontline length remains active across 1,200 kilometers, requiring 600,000 active personnel on both sides to man.
20. Urban control of Chasiv Yar is 90% Russian, with Ukrainian forces holding only the western micro-district.

### ATTRITION METRICS (THE INDUSTRIAL GRIND)
21. Russian military fatalities were confirmed at 35,000 in December 2025 and 30,000 in January 2026. 
22. The Russian "Replacement Ratio" is 1.1, meaning they are recruiting 1.1 soldiers for every 1 casualty.
23. Ukrainian daily KIA/WIA rate in the Pokrovsk sector is currently 140-180 personnel, deemed "unsustainable" by General Staff assessments.
24. The average age of a Ukrainian infantryman on the zero-line has risen to 44 years old.
25. Russia has deployed 5,000 troops from the "Africa Corps" (ex-Wagner) back to Ukraine to stiffen assault units. 
26. The artillery fire ratio across the front is 5:1 in Russia’s favor (approx. 10,000 vs. 2,000 shells/day).
27. North Korea supplied 3.2 million 152mm shells to Russia in 2025, constituting 60% of current Russian usage.
28. The "dud rate" of North Korean shells fired in Jan 2026 was 12%, causing significant barrel wear on Russian howitzers.
29. Ukraine’s domestic 155mm production reached 40,000 shells/month in Jan 2026, meeting only 20% of demand.
30. The "Barrel Famine": Russia is retiring 150 artillery pieces per month due to barrel exhaustion, replacing them with towed Soviet stocks from the 1950s.
31. Ukraine achieved an annualized production rate of 2.1 million FPV drones in 2025. 
32. Russia’s "Sudoplatov" volunteer group is delivering 50,000 FPV drones monthly to the front.
33. The average life expectancy of a quadcopter on the zero-line is 3 flights.
34. FPV drones now account for 60% of all inflicted fire damage on the frontline, surpassing artillery (40%).
35. Both sides are currently missing their "Million Drone" quotas for 2026 due to the global silicon scarcity (microcontroller shortages).

### WEAPON SYSTEM LIFECYCLE
36. Ukraine’s operational F-16 fleet stands at 32 airframes (of 54 delivered), with 22 grounded for maintenance or repairs.
37. F-16 sorties are restricted to stand-off operations (>40km from front) due to Russian S-400 density.
38. Russia has introduced the Su-35S2, a modernized variant with upgraded R-37M missiles tailored to hunt F-16s.
39. Ukraine lost 4 F-16s to runway strikes in Jan 2026; dispersed basing is now the primary defensive doctrine.
40. Swedish Saab Gripen transfers (promised in 2025) are delayed until Q3 2026 due to avionics supply chain issues.
41. Russia launched 14 North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles in Jan 2026; Ukraine intercepted only 1. 
42. The 2025-model KN-23 has a demonstrated range of 900km, placing Lviv within range from Bryansk launch sites.

73. The "Zelenskyy Formula" has been amended to prioritize "Physical Security" over "Immediate De-occupation" in Track II dialogues.
74. Ukraine’s mobilization law (Dec 2025) lowered the draft age to 23, sparking localized protests in Transcarpathia.
75. Kyiv refuses to hold Presidential Elections until the end of martial law; the next window is tentatively Oct 2026.
76. The Western Mediator Proposal ("Cold Freeze") envisions a ceasefire along the February 2026 Line of Contact.
77. The proposal includes a UN-monitored DMZ 5km wide on either side of the zero-line.
78. It offers Ukraine "Article 4.5" guarantees: Automatic arms transfers and intelligence provision in case of renewed aggression, but no troops.
79. The proposal requires Russia to withdraw heavy artillery 50km back from the DMZ.
80. Status of Crimea and Donbas would be deferred for 15 years of diplomatic negotiation.
