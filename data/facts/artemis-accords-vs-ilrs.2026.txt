SUBJECT: LUNAR JURISDICTION & RESOURCE EXTRACTION: ARTEMIS VS. ILRS
FROM: DEPARTMENT OF WAR / SPACE STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE (SSI)

### THE ARTEMIS ACCORDS (WESTERN BLOC)
1. Signatory Expansion: As of February 2026, Oman has become the 61st signatory, solidifying a "Global West" coalition that includes 28 European and 15 Asian nations.
2. Artemis II Status: The mission is currently in "Wet Dress Rehearsal" phase at Kennedy Space Center. Launch of the crew (Wiseman, Glover, Koch, Hansen) is slated for March 2026.
3. Commercial Utility Validation: NASA has officially transitioned to "Anchor Tenant" status, with private firms (SpaceX/Starship HLS) now holding the primary hardware leverage for lunar descent.
4. "Safety Zones" Logic: The Accords utilize Section 11 to create "Safety Zones" to avoid "harmful interference." Critics in the G77 label these as "de facto homesteading" and "Lunar Enclosure."
5. Property Rights Loophole: The US stance maintains that extracting lunar resources (ice/Helium-3) does not constitute "national appropriation" under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.
6. The "Gateway" Bottleneck: The HALO and PPE modules of the Lunar Gateway are currently the only high-bandwidth relay nodes in cislunar space not controlled by a national military.
7. Selective Realism: The 2026 National Defense Strategy (NDS) explicitly prioritizes "American Space Dominance" over multilateral "Province of Mankind" rhetoric.
8. Starlink-Moon: SpaceX has begun deploying a dedicated lunar constellation to provide independent comms for "Artemis-adjacent" private mining interests.
9. Heritage Protection: Accords signatories use "Historic Site Preservation" (e.g., Apollo 11) to legally lock down high-value topographic terrain near resource-rich craters.
10. The "Trump Corollary": Recent 2026 White House directives suggest US military protection for private US commercial lunar assets under "Mission Authorization."

### THE ILRS (EASTERN BLOC / CHINA-RUSSIA)
11. ILRS Coalition: Led by China (CNSA) and Russia (Roscosmos), the bloc has expanded to include Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, Pakistan, and most recently, Kazakhstan and Oman (dual-track).
12. Chang’e-7 Mission: Scheduled for November 2026. Includes a "Hopper" designed specifically to fly into the shadowed floor of Shackleton Crater to find water ice.
13. State-Led Extraction: Unlike the Artemis private model, ILRS frames resource extraction as a "Sovereign State Function," rejecting private homesteading rights.
14. Nuclear Lunar Power: Russia and China have fast-tracked a 2035 plan for a lunar nuclear reactor, with initial prototype components arriving via Chang’e-8 (precursor).
15. Shackleton Crater "Rim-Lock": China’s proposed ILRS landing site sits on the illuminated rim of Shackleton, creating a physical "standoff" with planned Artemis IV habitats.
16. The "Sovereignty Firewall": ILRS nations reject Western "Safety Zones," viewing them as a violation of the 1967 Treaty's ban on territorial claims.
17. BRIX-Space Initiative: A sub-group of BRICS nations focused on creating an independent "Lunar Financial Ledger" for space-based resources.
18. High-Precision Landing: Chang’e-7 will deploy the first "Landmark Image Navigation" system, allowing for sub-meter accuracy in crater rim landings.
19. Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Tension: Recent 2025 Russian "debris tests" have raised fears of "Cislunar Denial" strategies to prevent Artemis logistics.
20. Open Payload Diplomacy: China is offering "free rides" to African and Middle Eastern payloads to build a "Lunar Silk Road" that bypasses US ITAR restrictions.

### THE HELIUM-3 & ICE STANDOFF
21. The "Water War" Metric: 1 ton of lunar ice is currently valued at $10M in "Avoided Launch Costs" for deep space fuel.
22. H3 Speculation: Private harvesters are already "tokenizing" future Helium-3 yields, creating a trillion-dollar speculative bubble on Earth.
23. The 1967 Treaty Fracture: Legal scholars agree the Outer Space Treaty is "functionally dead" as of 2026; it cannot handle the scale of 10-gigawatt lunar mining.
24. Cislunar Shadow Market: Unofficial "gray-market" data swaps of lunar mineral maps between Artemis and ILRS corporate subsidiaries.
25. "Homesteading" Precedent: If a private harvester deploys an Exclusion Zone Beacon in 2026, it sets a "Possession is 9/10ths" legal precedent.
26. Kinetic De-escalation: Neither side has weapons in lunar orbit (publicly), but "harassment by rover" (blocking solar panels) is a high-probability conflict.
27. The Shackleton Rim: Only 3-4 viable "peaks of eternal light" exist on the South Pole rim; the first nation to land rovers there effectively controls the region's power.
28. International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) Guidebook: Formally rejects the concept of "Priority Rights" for first-comers.
29. Heritage vs. Resource: The US claims Shackleton rim is a "Heritage Site"; China claims it is "Open Territory."
30. The "Gateway" Jurisdiction: If an Artemis astronaut and an ILRS cosmonaut share a module, whose law applies? (2026 Jurisdictional Void).
