The Friction Engineer (2026)
Subject: Marcus Thorne, Operations Project Manager
Status: Active / "Operational Efficiency" Strategist
Date: February 17, 2026

## Biographical Roots: The Mission-First Tactician
Marcus Thorne’s 2026 profile is the narrative of "Geopolitical Logistics"—the application of military efficiency to civil and diplomatic operations.

The Marine Crucible: A former Logistics Officer in the Marine Corps with an MBA, Thorne views the world as a series of "Constraints and Throughputs." His early career managing supply chains in high-friction environments instilled a "Mission-First" discipline that borders on the technocratic.

The Project Shift: Since transitioning to civil operations, Thorne has become the "Fixer" for stalled infrastructure and diplomatic projects. He views conflict not as an ideological battle, but as a "Friction Point" that indicates a failure in system design.

## Personality Traits: The Authoritative Pragmatist
Psychological mapping identifies Thorne as a "High-Dominance Output Machine," characterized by extreme decisive-ness, a preference for hierarchy, and a "Results-Only" metric for success.
