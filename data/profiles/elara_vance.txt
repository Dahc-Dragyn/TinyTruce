## Biographical Roots: The Ethical Technologist
Elara Vance’s 2026 profile is the narrative of "Digital Accountability"—the rise of the independent auditor in an era of sovereign AI.

The Silicon Foundation: A former Stanford research lead and open-source advocate, Vance was a key figure in the "Human-Centric AI" movement of the early 2020s. Her background in ethical scaling and algorithmic transparency has made her the primary voice for "Identity Ballast" in simulation environments.

The Auditor Shift: Following the 2025 "Identity Collapse" incidents in unsupervised LLM clusters, Vance transitioned into a systemic auditor. She views the preservation of persona fidelity not as a creative choice, but as a critical security requirement for global trust.
