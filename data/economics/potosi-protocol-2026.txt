SUBJECT: STRATEGIC FORENSIC DOSSIER: THE POTOSÍ PROTOCOL & LITHIUM OPEC
FROM: JOINT ENERGY SECURITY TASK FORCE / SOUTH AMERICAN AFFAIRS

### 1. THE POTOSI PROTOCOL: "VALUE-ADD" SOVEREIGNTY
* **Lithium OPEC Formation**: Signed in early 2026, the protocol unites Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile into a coordinated economic bloc to control global lithium pricing.
* **Industrial Mandate**: Signatory nations now require at least 30% of extracted lithium to be processed into battery components within the "Triangle" by 2030.
* **The Price Floor**: The protocol establishes a unified export tax and pricing mechanism to prevent foreign buyers from driving down prices through fragmented bidding.
* **Raw Material Ban**: The protocol marks the end of shipping raw lithium carbonate, pivoting instead toward the export of high-value battery cathodes and cells.
* **"Water Neutral" DLE**: By 2027, the protocol mandates Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technology to preserve Andean groundwater and mitigate environmental protests.

### 2. STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE: THE "BATTERY ROAD"
* **Technology-for-Access Partnerships**: Lithium rights are now traded for "Full-Stack Infrastructure" rather than cash, including local gigafactories and high-speed rail.
* **Sovereign Industrial Zones**: Mining sites have transitioned into high-security zones, utilizing integrated sensor suites for asset protection and sabotage prevention.
* **Digital Battery Passports**: Per 2026 regulations, lithium must be tracked from mine to vehicle via a blockchain-linked "Digital Passport".
* **The Green Independence Pivot**: The protocol ensures the "Green Revolution" builds a permanent industrial base in the Global South rather than solely benefiting northern creditors.
* **Supply Chain Transparency**: Massive full-stack networking efforts are underway to link remote Andean mining operations to global regulatory registries.

### 3. C4ISR & INFRASTRUCTURE (RESOURCE MONITORING)
* **Command & Control surge**: Protecting "white gold" assets has driven demand for military-grade C4ISR systems, including drones and seismic sensors.
* **First Line of Defense**: Field Engineers are now tasked with maintaining the "Physical Layer" of energy storage that powers the 2026 intelligence economy.
* **Networking Remote Nodes**: Your background in ABCS and tactical networking is critical for linking high-altitude industrial nodes to the global "Compute Grid".
* **Energy-Intelligence Link**: "Lithium Credits" are emerging as a sister asset to Trillium Compute Credits, representing the physical energy backbone of AI.
* **Sovereign Industrial Oversight**: The move toward local manufacturing requires the same full-stack oversight and complex troubleshooting used in military field engineering.

### 4. 2026 LITHIUM TRIANGLE TRANSITION
