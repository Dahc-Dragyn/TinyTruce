DATE: February 19, 2026
SUBJECT: STRATEGIC FORENSIC DOSSIER: THE JAKARTA MARITIME ACCORD (COC 2.0)
FROM: ASEAN MARITIME SECURITY CELL / JAKARTA COORDINATION HUB

### THE JAKARTA ACCORD (DRAFT 2026)
1. The 2026 Deadline: ASEAN and China are "politically committed" to a legally binding Code of Conduct (CoC) by the end of 2026. The AMM Retreat in Cebu (Jan 2026) reaffirmed this as a "Non-Negotiable Target."
2. UNCLOS Anchor: The draft is grounded strictly in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, creating a direct legal clash with the "Nine-Dash Line" historical narrative.
3. Crisis Hotline Protocol: Establishes a 24/7 direct encrypted link between all ASEAN Coast Guard HQs and the Southern Theater Command of the PLA Navy to prevent "Accidental Escalation."
4. Safety of Navigation Zones: Proposes mandatory 500-meter "Buffer Zones" around all offshore energy platforms and disputed features to prevent "Water Cannon" skirmishes.
5. Resource Sovereignty: Reaffirms that non-claimants like Indonesia have exclusive rights to manage fisheries and gas in their North Natuna Sea EEZ without foreign "consultation."

### THE "TECHNICAL TEETH" (UK-INDONESIA DEAL)
6. £4 Billion Maritime Partnership: Signed in late 2025 by Starmer and Prabowo; focuses on revitalizing Indonesian shipbuilding with "Digital Design" and AI-driven automation.
7. The Babcock Frigate: Indonesia’s state shipbuilder (PAL) is fast-tracking the "Merah Putih" Frigate project using British Arrowhead 140 designs to provide the hardware for Accord enforcement.
8. AI-Driven Monitoring: The deal includes a £1.1 billion sub-package for "Maritime Domain Awareness" (MDA), using AI to track "Dark Fleet" vessels and illegal fishing in real-time.
9. Protein Security: President Prabowo has linked the success of the Accord to his "National Protein" initiative, requiring secure access to fishing grounds in the Natuna Sea.
10. Technology Transfer: The UK is providing "Integrated Naval Systems" expertise, allowing Indonesia to act as the "Technical Anchor" for ASEAN’s joint maritime patrols.

### GEOPOLITICAL VECTORS & STANDOFFS
11. The "Shiprider" Balance: The US Coast Guard has expanded "Shiprider" agreements with the Philippines and Vietnam (Feb 2026), placing US personnel on ASEAN hulls—a move China calls "External Interference."
12. The Natuna Pivot: Indonesia has abandoned its "honest broker" stance for "Mediator with a Shield," citing the 255 illegal vessels impounded in 2025 as proof of the need for hard rules.
13. Arbitration Sticking Point: Manila and Hanoi demand a "Third-Party Arbitration" clause in the Accord; Beijing insists on "Consensus-Based Resolution" only.
14. Undersea Cable Security: The draft includes new "Protection Zones" for the critical data cables connecting Singapore to the global web (see Scenario #6).
15. The "Cebu Consensus": The Jan 2026 AMM Retreat highlighted a growing split: "Security Realists" (PH/VN/ID) vs. "Economic Quietists" (KH/LA) over the CoC’s binding nature.

### INTERVENTIONS & "REDLINE" TRIGGERS
16. Unintended Escalation: US Coast Guard Vice Adm. Gautier (Feb 2026) warned that "assertive actions" in resource-rich zones are nearing a "Kinetic Threshold."
17. The "Grey Zone" Counter: China has deployed "Nature Reserve" markers on disputed shoals as a legal counter-claim to the Accord’s EEZ definitions.
18. MAHASAGAR Synergy: India’s naval presence (INS Tir, Jan 2026) in Indonesian waters acts as a "Secondary Shield" for the Jakarta Accord’s legitimacy.
19. Satellite Transparency: The AU-style "Shadow Models" (from Scenario #5) are being adapted by ASEAN to provide undeniable evidence of CoC violations.
20. The 2026 Signing: If the Accord remains a "Draft" by December 2026, the Philippines has threatened to pursue a "Mini-Lateral" treaty with the US and Japan, effectively ending ASEAN centrality.
