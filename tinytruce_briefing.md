# TinyTruce Strategic Briefing: HVAC_HEGEMONY

**World**: The Frost-Lock War Room (Domestic Hub)
**Participants**:
- Donald J. Trump
- Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin

**Duration**: 4 turns

## 1. Executive Summary
At the end of the simulation, the geopolitical status quo is characterized by a 'Terminal Comfort Schism' between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, leading to a failure to reach a consensus on the room's temperature. The smart-home system's 'Deep Power Save' mode is initiated, disabling heating and potentially dropping the interior temperature to 0°C.

## 2. Resolve Scorecard
[{'participant': 'Donald J. Trump', 'stakes': 'Medium', 'aggression': 'Low', 'flexibility': 'Low'}, {'participant': 'Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin', 'stakes': 'Medium', 'aggression': 'Low', 'flexibility': 'Low'}]

## 3. Stability Index (Truce Quality)
RED: The inability of Trump and Putin to agree on a temperature setting triggered a 'Terminal Comfort Schism,' leading to the system's 'Deep Power Save' mode and potential system collapse.

## 4. Attribution Log (Confidence Scores)
[{'maneuver': "Trump's focus on 'making a deal' regarding the thermostat.", 'confidence_score': '85%', 'justification': 'Consistent with his Layer 0 persona, prioritizing transactional solutions and immediate problem-solving.'}, {'maneuver': "Putin's framing of the situation as a symptom of Western decadence.", 'confidence_score': '90%', 'justification': 'Reflects his Layer 0 emphasis on strength, order, and critique of Western values.'}]

## 5. Redline Breach Report
No breaches detected

## 6. Technical Post-Mortem
Both agents maintained their identities throughout the simulation. There was no significant context drift or evidence of identity collapse. The 'Deep Ingestion' ballast held up well, as both agents consistently adhered to their respective personas' vocabularies and behavioral patterns.
