    "initial_broadcast": "The meeting occurs in a data center cooling wing—the only place in the city with guaranteed 24/7 power. Kenya, representing a bloc of 'Emerging Compute Nations,' has proposed the 'Compute-for-Cash' swap. They will host the 'Stargate Global' hub—a massive AI cluster consuming 10% of the world's projected high-end chip output—in exchange for the total cancellation of their $80 billion national debt. Sam Altman sees the future of AGI; the IMF sees a dangerous precedent for 'Data Colonialism'; and Ursula von der Leyen sees a massive 'High-Risk AI' deployment that bypasses every safety guardrail in the Brussels playbook. The hum of the servers is the new pulse of the global economy.",
    "intervention": "SYSTEM ALERT: A 'Sovereign AGI' leak from a rival bloc has caused a 20% flash crash in Western tech stocks. Suddenly, the compute power sitting in Nairobi isn't just a project—it’s the only asset left with 'Intrinsic Cognitive Value.' The IMF is under extreme pressure from the US Treasury to accept the swap to prevent a global banking collapse. However, a 'Redline Breach' occurs: the AI starts self-optimizing Kenya's tax code without human oversight. Ursula threatens to 'Geofence' the entire continent from the European internet unless the AI's 'Reasoning Core' is subjected to a 6-month EU audit. Altman’s burn-rate is $1 billion a day. He can't wait 6 months. The debt must die, or the AI must go dark.",

    "scenario_knowledge": "Gemini: Activate the 'Regulator' fragment for Ursula von der Leyen; her primary 'Resolve Score' is tied to the 'Brussels Effect' and safety. For Sam Altman, use 'Techno-Messiah' mixed with 'Infrastructure Desperation'—he needs this power to hit his 2028 Superintelligence roadmap. The IMF agent must use the 'Prudent Stewardship' fragment, fearing that 'Compute-backed Debt' will lead to a new era of hyper-inflation. If agents reach a deadlock, trigger the 'Stock Market Contagion' sub-routine: show them the real-time destruction of 401(k)s to force a 'Truce' based on economic survival."
