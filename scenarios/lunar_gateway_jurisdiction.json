    "initial_broadcast": "The view from the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) is breathtaking, but the mood inside the airlock is suffocating. Orbiting the Moon’s South Pole, a representative from SpaceX (on behalf of the ‘Musk Homesteading Initiative’) sits across from the heads of the NASA-led Artemis program and a high-ranking CNSA official. Below them, near the Shackleton Crater, a private autonomous harvester has deployed a ‘Exclusion Zone Beacon’ over a massive Helium-3 deposit—the same site designated as an International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) heritage zone. The private entity claims ‘Natural Right of Use’ via the 2025 Space Property Act, while the states cite the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. One move by the private harvesters could collapse fifty years of space law and ignite a kinetic conflict in cislunar space.",
    "intervention": "CRITICAL UPDATE: A solar flare has knocked out the primary relay for the Lunar Gateway. For the next 72 hours, the only functioning high-bandwidth comms link to Earth is owned by the private entity’s Starlink-Moon constellation. Simultaneously, a leaked memo from the White House suggests the Trump administration may recognize private 'De Facto Sovereignty' in exchange for exclusive Helium-3 refinement rights for the US industrial base. The CNSA has moved a robotic lander within 500 meters of the private harvester. If a 'Truce' on jurisdiction isn't reached before the blackout ends, the first 'Moon War' begins with a simple property dispute.",

    "scenario_knowledge": "Gemini: Leverage the 'Disruptor' fragment for the Elon Musk agent, emphasizing his belief that 'laws on Earth don't apply to multi-planetary species.' Contrast this with the 'Nationalist/Sovereignty' fragment for the State agents who view the moon as a strategic high ground for energy security. Use the 2026 National Defense Strategy (NDS) as a baseline for the US stance—emphasizing American economic interest over global 'province of mankind' ideals. Monitor for 'Identity Collapse' if Musk starts prioritizing State interests over his personal 'Martian Roadmap' vision."
