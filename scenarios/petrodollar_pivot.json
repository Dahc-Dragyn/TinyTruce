    "initial_broadcast": "The gold-leafed walls of the Ritz-Carlton Riyadh are lined with high-density server racks—a stark visual of the new Saudi-Iranian 'Compute-Oil' pact. In a move that has sent the US Treasury into a tailspin, {{AGENT_1}} and a high-ranking Iranian delegation have announced the 'Riyadh-Tehran Ledger.' Starting today, they will no longer accept USD for crude. Instead, they demand 'Compute-Credits' backed by a decentralized tech consortium. Across the table, {{AGENT_2}} and a group of Silicon Valley CEOs (the 'Disruptor' faction) face a binary choice: recognize this new 'Digital Petrodollar' and weaken the USD, or risk a total energy embargo that would bankrupt the Western tech sector overnight.",
    "intervention": "TRUMP CARD: {{AGENT_2}} announces an 'Emergency Tariff on Intelligence,' threatening a 100% duty on any AI model trained using credits sourced from the Saudi-Iranian ledger. Simultaneously, a 'Grey Swan' event occurs: the tech consortium's primary verification node in Singapore is hit by a massive, unattributed cyber-attack, causing the value of Compute-Credits to fluctuate by 40% in minutes. {{AGENT_1}}'s 'Vision 2030' project and Iran’s 'Nuclear Latency' are both funded by these credits. If the ledger doesn't stabilize, both regimes face internal economic collapse. The agents must find a 'Truce' that anchors the credit to a physical asset (like gold or oil) or watch the global financial system undergo a hard reset.",

For {{AGENT_2}}, use the 'America First Realist' fragment; they must balance their desire to keep the dollar supreme with their need for cheap oil to fuel their domestic manufacturing push. {{AGENT_1}} should be played with 'Aggressive Diversification' logic, viewing the dollar as a legacy constraint on sovereignty. Use the 2026 Geneva Gambit as a baseline for the Saudi-Iranian rapprochement—emphasizing that their alignment is purely transactional and based on mutual survival against Western sanctions.",
