Inside the EMP-shielded 'Thriving Economy' hub, the air is thick with the weight of the 'Great Reset.' The June 2025 war has passed, but it has left a region of high fences and nuclear breakout clocks. The 'Axis of Resistance' has integrated, the Abraham Accords have militarized, and Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 is currently the only regional anchor holding back total chaos. The objective is to stabilize the IMEC corridor and prevent a second kinetic rupture as Iran approaches the 90% enrichment threshold.",

Simultaneously, a coordinated Houthi drone swarm has successfully targeted an IMEC 'Land Bridge' convoy near the Saudi-Jordanian border. The 'Armed Truce' is on the verge of collapsing into a total theater war.",
