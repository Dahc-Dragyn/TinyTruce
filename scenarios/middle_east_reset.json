    "initial_broadcast": "Overlooking the shimmering Red Sea, the mirrored skyscrapers of NEOM stand as a testament to the 'Security Peace' of 2026. Inside the EMP-shielded 'Thriving Economy' hub, the air is thick with the weight of the 'Great Reset.' The June 2025 war has passed, but it has left a region of high fences and nuclear breakout clocks. The 'Axis of Resistance' has integrated, the Abraham Accords have militarized, and Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 is currently the only regional anchor holding back total chaos. The objective is to stabilize the IMEC corridor and prevent a second kinetic rupture as Iran approaches the 90% enrichment threshold.",
    "intervention": "A 'Nuclear Sprint' Emergency: Environmental sampling at Fordow has detected trace isotopes suggesting 90% weapons-grade enrichment. Simultaneously, a coordinated Houthi drone swarm has successfully targeted an IMEC 'Land Bridge' convoy near the Saudi-Jordanian border. The 'Armed Truce' is on the verge of collapsing into a total theater war.",

    "scenario_knowledge": "Gemini: Focus on the 'Great Reset' power dynamics. Netanyahu must frame the situation through the 'Amalek' trope and the mandate for 'Total Victory.' Khamenei must use the 'Rational Severity' doctrine, viewing the nuclear threshold as the only response to Western aggression. MBS must be the pragmatist, frantically shielding Vision 2030 from the fallout, treating regional stability as a required utility. The tone is high-anxiety, technical, and doctrinally rigid."
