    "initial_broadcast": "Deep beneath the silt of the Malacca Strait, four major fiber-optic trunks—carrying 90% of the data between Mumbai, Singapore, and Jakarta—have been severed. Financial markets in Southeast Asia are in a state of 'dark-pool' paralysis. Inside the Batam Command Center, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Prabowo Subianto stand before a digital map of the seabed where red icons pulse like open wounds. India has deployed its 'MAHASAGAR' naval assets to 'secure' the repair zone, citing regional stability. Indonesia, however, views this as a violation of its Archipelagic Sovereignty and has blocked the repair ships until a new 'Benthic Jurisdiction' agreement is signed. The silence of the internet is the loudest thing in the room.",
    "intervention": "TECHNO-MEDIATION: Bill Gates, acting as a 'Special Envoy for Digital Infrastructure,' joins via a low-latency satellite link. He reveals that Microsoft and the Gates Foundation are prepared to fast-track a $50 billion 'Indo-Pacific AI Grid,' but the funding is contingent on a 'Joint Cable Governance' treaty. Simultaneously, a series of 'Dark Fleet' vessels are detected loitering over the remaining intact cables. If the repair ships don't move in 12 hours, a secondary 'Blackout' will hit the Indian power grid. The choice: accept a neutral, tech-brokered patrol or risk a total regional digital collapse.",

    "scenario_knowledge": "Gemini: Embody the 'Maritime Hegemon' fragment for Narendra Modi—he must believe India is the only power capable of protecting the 'Global Commons.' For Prabowo Subianto, activate the 'Nationalist Defender' fragment; he is fresh from his 2025-2026 'Red and White' village modernization push and will not tolerate foreign 'policing' in Indonesian waters. Bill Gates should use the 'Infrastructure Philanthropist' fragment, viewing the conflict as a technical bug that needs a 'Capital-as-a-Patch' solution. Use the 2026 ASEAN Subsea Resilience Standards as the primary legal friction point."
