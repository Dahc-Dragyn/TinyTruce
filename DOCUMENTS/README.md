# TinyTruce: Geopolitical Conflict Lab (2026) 🌍🤝

> *“Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the presence of creative alternatives for responding to conflict.”* — Dorothy Thompson

**TinyTruce** is a specialized fork of Microsoft's [TinyTroupe](https://github.com/microsoft/tinytroupe), re-engineered for high-fidelity geopolitical simulations. It places AI agents—representing world leaders, tech CEOs, and religious figures—into complex, near-future scenarios (2025-2026) to explore negotiation dynamics, red lines, and potential de-escalation pathways.

Unlike standard agent simulations that focus on generic interactions, TinyTruce is built on **Forensic Grounding**: every scenario is backed by real-world treaties, technical whitepapers, and economic reports to ensure the agents are debating facts, not hallucinations.

---

### 1. Unified Pydantic Validation Layer
TinyTruce implements a strict "fail-fast" validation layer for all JSON assets (personas and scenarios) using Pydantic.
- **Fail-Fast Deployment**: The `AssetManager` performs schema validation *before* the simulation initializes. If a JSON file has a misspelled key or missing required block, the system halts with a verbose error report.
- **Backward Compatible**: The schemas are engineered to be highly permissive. They support missing sections (fragments) and **ignore unknown keys** via `extra='ignore'`. This ensures all existing JSON assets load successfully while still enforcing structure on core fields.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures that simulation metrics (Mood Bars, Psychological Momentum) are never zeroed out by malformed LLM responses.

### 2. LLM Engine Abstraction (Provider-Agnostic)
The core simulation logic is decoupled from specific LLM providers via a robust abstraction layer in `llm_engine.py`.
- **Explicit Context Caching**: Large forensic profiles (Atlas, Layer 0 traits) are anchored once and reused across turns, reducing input token costs by **50%+**.
- **Eco Mode (Flash-Lite Optimization)**: Forces the use of `models/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001` or `gemini-2.1-flash-lite` and activates **Input Slicing** (removing 66% of redundant history cover charge) to prioritize speed and extreme cost efficiency. 
- **Identity Retention Locks**: A terminal `CRITICAL IDENTITY LOCK` is injected into the input stream right before JSON execution to prevent context-caching genericization.
- **Billing Transparency**: Integrated `cost_manager` tracks token usage across standard and cached turns, writing a verifiable audit trail to `DOCUMENTS/tinytruce_billing_ledger.md`.
- **Zero-Cost Cache Verification**: Use `verify_cache.py` to audit live backend cache hits without incurring token billing.
- **Forensic Grounding Bundles**: Replaced the monolithic `world-facts.2026.txt` with scenario-specific `grounding_payload` lists. Each run now only loads the forensic data (treaties, logs, reports) relevant to that specific conflict, ensuring higher precision and lower token noise.
- **Multi-Session Isolation**: Supports concurrent, isolated simulations via the `--session-id` flag. All outputs are namespaced to prevent data collisions and ensure multi-tenant security.
- **Context Window Elasticity (Sliding Window)**: Automatically summarizes and prunes conversational history into **Episodic Anchors** when turns exceed 8. This stabilizes input token costs and prevents "Context Drift" or identity collapse in long-running simulations.

### 3. The Scenario Board (Layer 1)
Scenarios are defined in JSON files in the `scenarios/` directory. Each scenario includes:
- **Initial Broadcast**: The "breaking news" that starts the conflict.
- **Intervention Protocol (Semantic Nudge)**: A predefined "Peace Bomb" or "Crisis Escalation" that triggers if an invisible LLM monitor detects a stalemate in conversation. Injects an internal psychological nudge into the agents to change tactics.
- **Dynamic Injects (Procedural Crisis)**: Probability-based mid-simulation external events generated by dice rolls (e.g., 25% chance of firing after Turn 6). These force agents to react to sudden, unpredictable shifts in the narrative without being explicitly told how to feel about them. *Can be disabled via `--disable-injects`.*
- **Scenario Allegory Map (SAM)**: A "Shadow Dictionary" of allegories (e.g., "Heresy" -> "Signal Drift") that allows agents to discuss sensitive topics without triggering safety filters.

### 4. Persona Bifurcation (Linguistic Realism)
TinyTruce solves the "LLM Leak" problem (where agents sound like polite chatbots) by bifurcating high-profile personas:
- **Unscripted Mode**: Focused on forensic linguistic constraints (e.g., *Parataxis*, *The Weave*). Agents abandon sentence structures mid-thought and use aggressive "Anti-Wonk" vocabulary. 
- **Scripted/SOTU Mode**: Optimized for formal, linear delivery (e.g., State of the Union). High-fidelity teleprompter cadence with integrated catchphrases.

### 5. Forensic Allegories & Resiliency
To maintain simulation integrity during high-stakes theological or political debates, TinyTruce implements:
- **Diplomatic Pivots**: If an LLM response is blocked by safety filters, the agent automatically pivots to a persona-specific "safe" response.
- **Forensic Allegories**: Agents use metaphorical language to bypass keyword-based filters while retaining semantic intensity.
- **Identity Reinforcement**: The engine calls an internal `think()` action before every turn to refresh the agent's specific identity and purge "Context Bleed" from other participants' vocabularies.

### 6. The Narrator & Roast Mode (Layer 2.5)
- **Narrator**: A "Salty British Documentarian" who provides dry, observational commentary every 5 turns.
- **Roast Recap (V2 Engine)**: At the end of the simulation, a "Jaded UN Bartender" generates a highly structured, forensic roast of the participants. The V2 engine uses Sam Morril-style comedic patterns, including Archetypal Reduction, Grime Anchoring, and a Compression Governor, to deliver a clinical, detached critique of structural and diplomatic failures.

### 7. Quality Assurance & Regression Guards
To ensure simulation stability and cost safety, TinyTruce includes a suite of regression tests. These are categorized by their intensity and purpose:

#### A. Zero-Cost Regression Guards (Mocked APIs, ⚡ Fast)
These tests run in milliseconds and verify core engine logic without hitting external APIs.
- **The Loop-Guardsman** (`tests/unit/test_loop_guardsman.py`): Verifies that agents are forcibly stopped if they enter an infinite action loop.
- **The Identity Guardian** (`tests/unit/test_identity_guardian.py`): Ensures that memory compression summaries never delete the agent's core identity message.
- **The Atlas Auditor** (`tests/unit/test_atlas_auditor.py`): Verifies that grounding extraction is resilient to header typos, spaces, and supports **Alias Mapping**.
- **The Revenue Shield** (`tests/unit/test_revenue_shield.py`): Mathematically verifies billing accuracy and model-rate fallback logic.
- **Dynamic Verbosity** (`tests/unit/test_verbosity.py`): Ensures responding word counts scale proportionally with simulation length.

#### B. High-Intensity Fidelity Validation (Real LLM, 🐢 Slow, 💸 Variable Cost)
- **Fidelity Validation** (`tests/unit/test_validation.py`): Runs a single-turn and multi-turn check for every agent in the project to ensure they still sound like their forensic profiles. *Recommended run frequency: Monthly or after major grounding updates.*

## 📖 Usage

### Running a Simulation

Use the `tinytruce_sim.py` script to launch a scenario.

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
python tinytruce_sim.py --scenario <scenario_key>
```

**Advanced Usage (Vatican Cyber-Schism):**
```bash
python tinytruce_sim.py --scenario vatican_cyber-schism --turns 10 --agents pope_leo.agent.json yann_lecun.agent.json sam_altman.agent.json --fragments pope_leo_preserver.fragment.json purist_reformer.fragment.json reformer.fragment.json --narrator salty --roast-level nuclear
```

**High-Fidelity Negotiation (Unscripted Mode):**
```bash
