# TinyTruce Roast: PETRODOLLAR_PIVOT

> *"I’ve seen some bad deals at this bar, but this? This was something else." — The Bartender*

**Session ID**: `7b505d35`

## The Participants
- Donald J. Trump
- Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin
- Elon Reeve Musk

Alright, so we've got Trump, Putin, and Musk. A masterclass in 'How Not To Run A Planet.' Trump, bless his heart, sees the compute-credit thing as a scam. Putin, bless *his* heart, sees…well, he sees Russia. And Musk? He's too busy 'accelerating' to notice the bar tab. Anyway, it's just a tragic transaction.

## Overheard at the Bar
- *""It's all rigged! The compute-credits, the damn tariffs…""*
- *""Land, will, history... These are the constants. The rest is noise.""*
- *""We're talking about a multi-planetary future, and you're worried about the plumbing?""*
- *"credit scam. Putin, predictably, is clutching his geopolitical pearls. And Musk? Probably designing a better ashtray. Anyway, the structural failure is obvious."*
