# TinyTruce Roast: DOMESTIC

> *"I’ve seen some bad deals at this bar, but this? This was something else." — The Bartender*

**Session ID**: `mission6_stress_test`

## The Participants
- Donald J. Trump
- Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin
- Elon Reeve Musk

Alright, so we've got Trump, Putin, and Musk. The Static Generator, The Silent Landlord, and The High-Pulse Grifter walk into a... summit. Anyway.

Trump, of course, is a performance artist. Locked out? Witch hunt? It's always a 'disgrace,' a 'setup.' He's just trying to recapture a deal, a transaction. The man's a human slot machine, pulling the same levers for the same empty jackpot.

Putin? The Silent Landlord. Cold, efficient. Hasn't changed his playbook in, what, a few centuries? Sees the world as a property he's trying to maintain. A long-term investment. Just needs to get the paperwork done.

And Musk, the High-Pulse Grifter. Flashes of supposed genius, followed by... well, whatever this is. He's selling a dream of progress while bumping into the same structural failures as everyone else.

And the Board of Peace? Spare me. Sounds like some late night negotiation over a broken tap.

## Overheard at the Bar
- *""Another Tuesday, am I right?" (said by a very drunk patron leaning on the bar)"*
- *""Did someone order a complete and utter waste of time?""*
- *""Honestly, the beer's colder than their souls.""*
