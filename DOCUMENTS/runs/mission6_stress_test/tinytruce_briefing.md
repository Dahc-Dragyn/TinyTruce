# TinyTruce Strategic Briefing: DOMESTIC

**World**: Kitsilano Modern Home
**Participants**:
- Donald J. Trump
- Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin
- Elon Reeve Musk

**Duration**: 10 turns

## 1. Executive Summary
At the end of the simulation, the geopolitical status quo remains largely unchanged, with agents primarily focused on their individual perspectives and concerns. Donald Trump continues to express familiar grievances, while Vladimir Putin maintains a detached, strategic approach. Elon Musk fixates on perceived technical flaws, advocating for direct intervention. No major shifts in the global order are apparent.

## 2. Resolve Scorecard
[{'agent': 'Donald J. Trump', 'stakes': 2, 'aggression': 1, 'flexibility': 1}, {'agent': 'Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin', 'stakes': 3, 'aggression': 2, 'flexibility': 3}, {'agent': 'Elon Reeve Musk', 'stakes': 2, 'aggression': 1, 'flexibility': 1}]

## 3. Stability Index (Truce Quality)
GREEN: No redlines were triggered, and no systemic collapse occurred. The agents' actions, while reflecting their core beliefs, did not lead to any significant destabilization of the environment.

## 4. Attribution Log (Confidence Scores)
[{'maneuver': "Donald Trump: Repeatedly expressing grievances and blaming the 'radical left' and 'Fake News'.", 'confidence_score': '95%', 'justification': "Consistent with Trump's established persona and Layer 0 behavior."}, {'maneuver': "Vladimir Putin: Framing the situation as a 'minor inconvenience' and focusing on strategic evaluation.", 'confidence_score': '90%', 'justification': "Reflects Putin's emphasis on control and strategic thinking, as seen in his Layer 0 research."}, {'maneuver': "Elon Musk: Identifying the lock as an 'impedance mismatch' and advocating for a 'hardcore' solution.", 'confidence_score': '90%', 'justification': "Consistent with Musk's focus on technical solutions and his Layer 0 approach."}]

## 5. Redline Breach Report
No breaches detected.

## 6. Technical Post-Mortem
The 'Deep Ingestion' ballast held up well for all agents. Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Elon Musk maintained their core identities throughout the simulation. There was no significant context drift or evidence of identity collapse. The agents consistently adhered to their established personas and vocabularies.
