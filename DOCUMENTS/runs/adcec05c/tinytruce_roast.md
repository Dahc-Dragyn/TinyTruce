# TinyTruce Roast: SOTU_DELIVERY

> *"I’ve seen some bad deals at this bar, but this? This was something else." — The Bartender*

**Session ID**: `adcec05c`

## The Participants
- Elon Reeve Musk

Look, Musk. The future, according to you, is just a very expensive, inefficient bar tab. AGI is the house drink, the President's the bouncer, and you're the guy trying to pay with Bitcoin. Anyway, the whole thing's structurally unsound. Overheard at the bar: 'Musk's building the future, one over-leveraged tweet at a time.' And 'Did you hear? The Tesla factory has better air conditioning than the Oval Office.'

## Overheard at the Bar
- *"'He's accelerating towards a future where the only currency is self-regard.'"*
- *"'His 'mission' is just a glorified tech bro ego trip, served neat.'"*
