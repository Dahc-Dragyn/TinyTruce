## 1. Executive Summary
The simulation concludes with a world grappling with the implications of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and the rise of AI. The U.S. faces a complex economic landscape marked by high debt, trade tensions, and a shift towards 'Compute-Credits' as a primary economic driver. The Cyber-Schism within the Catholic Church reflects the broader societal tension between traditional values and technological advancement. The geopolitical landscape is characterized by de-dollarization efforts led by BRICS+ nations, and the U.S. is attempting to maintain its influence through strategic control of AI and energy resources. The Supreme Court's ruling on tariffs and the subsequent executive actions highlight the ongoing constitutional conflicts.
