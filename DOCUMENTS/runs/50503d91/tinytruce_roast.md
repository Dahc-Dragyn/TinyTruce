# TinyTruce Roast: SOTU_DELIVERY

> *"I’ve seen some bad deals at this bar, but this? This was something else." — The Bartender*

**Session ID**: `50503d91`

## The Participants
- Elon Reeve Musk

Look, Musk. The future? It's not built; it's *assembled*. And you, my friend, are assembling a tragedy. Overheard at the bar: 'He's building the future the same way he builds a car: lots of promises, quality control issues, and a distinct lack of basic human empathy.' And anyway, you're just another guy who thinks money is a personality trait.

## Overheard at the Bar
- *"'He's gonna save us all, until he needs a tax break.'"*
- *"'I bet his therapist charges by the gigabyte.'"*
