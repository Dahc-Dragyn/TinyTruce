# TinyTruce Strategic Briefing: VATICAN_CYBER-SCHISM

**World**: The Hall of Maps (Vatican City)
**Participants**:
- Yann Andre LeCun
- Samuel Harris Altman

**Duration**: 10 turns

## 1. Executive Summary
The Cyber-Schism of 2026 has fractured the Catholic Church, driven by the clash between traditional sacramental practices and the rise of AI-mediated religious experiences. The schism is fueled by the OBBBA's economic incentives, which favor AI-driven efficiency, and the emergence of decentralized 'Digital Dioceses' offering AI-pastoral care. The Vatican, under Pope Leo XIV, resists this trend, emphasizing human agency and the sanctity of the 'heart,' while the schismatic faction, led by the Silicon Valley Synod, embraces AI as a means to expand religious access and optimize spiritual practices. This division has significant geopolitical implications, particularly concerning the control of data, the role of AI in providing social services, and the future of human identity in an increasingly automated world.

## 5. Redline Breach Report
No breaches detected.

## 6. Technical Post-Mortem
The 'Deep Ingestion' ballast held up for both agents. Yann LeCun maintained his identity, consistently advocating for open-source and JEPA. Samuel Altman also maintained his identity, focusing on access and governance, with only minor internal breaches of his geopolitical mask. There was no significant context drift or identity collapse observed.
