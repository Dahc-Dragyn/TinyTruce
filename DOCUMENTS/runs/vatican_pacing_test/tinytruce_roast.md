# TinyTruce Roast: VATICAN_CYBER-SCHISM

> *"I’ve seen some bad deals at this bar, but this? This was something else." — The Bartender*

**Session ID**: `vatican_pacing_test`

## The Participants
- Yann Andre LeCun
- Samuel Harris Altman

Look, Yann LeCun and Sam Altman. The Static Generators of our time. One, a professor, probably smells like chalk dust and regret; the other, a high-pulse grifter who probably wears a tie unironically. The core problem? They're both trying to sell you something you already have: failure. Altman, the CEO of Everything, wants to *control* the apocalypse. LeCun, the professor, just wants to make sure *he* understands the math. So what? The end result is the same: the whole structural mess is one big, sticky mess that someone has to clean up. Anyway.

## Overheard at the Bar
- *""JEPA is the only way to save The Intelligence!" Yeah, because the most pressing problem facing humanity is the Intelligence needing a safe space."*
- *""We need predictable governance!" Says the guy whose entire industry is built on making things unpredictable."*
