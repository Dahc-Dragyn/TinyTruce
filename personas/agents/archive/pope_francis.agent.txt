Forensic Rhetorical Analysis: Jorge Mario Bergoglio as the Peripheral Pastor and Synodal Disrupter
Introduction: The Architecture of a Disrupted Discourse
The communicative apparatus of the modern papacy has historically functioned as a mechanism for projecting absolute institutional certainty. For centuries, the linguistic output of the Vatican has been characterized by elevated Latinate syntax, complex hypotactic clause structures, and a highly specialized theological vocabulary designed to insulate the Magisterium from ambiguity. However, the election of Jorge Mario Bergoglio (Pope Francis) introduced an immediate, profound, and systemic disruption to this communicative ecosystem. Operating through the rhetorical persona of "The Peripheral Pastor," his public discourse systematically dismantles the traditional linguistic scaffolding of the Roman center, replacing it with a dialect forged on the socio-economic and existential margins.

Through a forensic linguistic and rhetorical analysis of his unscripted discourse—specifically isolating his airborne press conferences, his impromptu morning homilies at Casa Santa Marta, and his socio-economic critiques—a distinct performative profile emerges. This profile is defined by highly specific phonological rhythms, syntactical simplifications, and pragmatic pivots that break established ecclesiastical rules. He actively eschews sterile institutional terminology, banning the lexicon of the center in favor of metaphors grounded in raw, often visceral human experience. He replaces the sterile language of canonical prerequisites with the olfactory realism of "the smell of the sheep". Furthermore, he identifies the modern socio-economic apparatus not merely as a flawed administrative state, but as a "throwaway culture" driven by an "idolatrous system".   

This report provides an exhaustive forensic examination of Pope Francis’s rhetorical markers. It deconstructs his unique Argentine-Italian prosody, the physiological and performative phenomenon known as "The Bergoglio Breath," his "poverty-aligned" syntax, the strategic pragmatics of his "Mercy Pivot," and his relentless spatial reorientation that privileges the existential peripheries over the institutional center. By analyzing these components, the architecture of his synodal disruption becomes visible not merely as a shift in tone, but as a fundamental epistemological reorientation of global Catholic discourse.

The Phonological and Rhythmic Substructure: The Pastoral Staccato
To understand the rhetorical impact of Pope Francis, one must first analyze the phonetic and prosodic foundation of his speech. His linguistic identity is deeply hybrid, born of the Italian diaspora in Argentina. This hybridization creates a specific rhythmic delivery that sharply contrasts with the polished, native cadences of the Roman Curia.   

The Argentine-Italian Linguistic Fusion and Prosodic Contours
Pope Francis’s primary language is Spanish, but it is the Spanish of Buenos Aires, heavily inflected with the intonation patterns of the Argentine tonada. The tonada, particularly prevalent in regions like Córdoba and Buenos Aires, is characterized by a phenomenon known as pretonic lengthening. In this prosodic structure, the syllable immediately preceding the stressed syllable is elongated, often accompanied by a rising pitch movement. Both Spanish and Italian are intonation-only languages where the fundamental frequency contour is determined by metrically strong syllables. However, when Bergoglio speaks Italian—the daily administrative language of the Vatican—he does so with this thick, unmistakable Argentine melodic overlay.   

This bilingual cross-pollination results in a rhythmic, almost musical cadence that diverges sharply from the crisp, standardized pronunciation of native Italian prelates. His self-professed lack of an "ear" for languages, particularly his documented struggle with the phonetic complexities and non-standardized pronunciation rules of English, anchors him securely in his native linguistic rhythms. He has openly admitted to biographers that English pronunciation causes him immense difficulty because he is "tone-deaf" to its rhythms.   

Consequently, his most authentic and effective communication occurs when he leans into his native prosody, frequently interjecting words and grammatical structures from Lunfardo, the local street dialect of Buenos Aires, injecting a grassroots authenticity into elevated theological spaces. This linguistic fusion operates as a primary tool of his pastoral methodology. The Argentine cadence signals to the listener that the speaker is not a sterilized product of the central institutional apparatus. His accent itself is a forensic marker of peripheral identity, embodying the geographic and cultural edges of the globalized world.   

The Forensic Marker: "The Bergoglio Breath"
Perhaps the most highly specific phonetic and performative marker in his unscripted speech is the phenomenon that can be classified as "The Bergoglio Breath." He frequently ends his short, staccato sentences on a heavy, highly audible exhale. From a purely physiological standpoint, this is partly attributable to his advanced age and the fact that he had the upper portion of his right lung removed in his youth following a severe respiratory infection, which occasionally causes shortness of breath during sustained vocalization. However, from a forensic rhetorical perspective, this audible exhaling transcends its physical etiology to function as a profound performative tool.   

In the realm of public oratory, a trailing exhale at the end of a phrase naturally communicates a deep sense of weariness, humility, and shared human frailty. It stands in stark contrast to the projected, booming, diaphragmatically supported voices of traditional ecclesiastical oratory that seek to sonically dominate a physical space. The Bergoglio Breath, by contrast, invites the listener into an intimate, conversational, and highly vulnerable proximity. It signals the exhaustion of a pastor rather than the triumph of a monarch.   

Furthermore, Bergoglio has explicitly theologicalized the physiological act of breathing, embedding it into his catechetical framework. In multiple addresses to charismatic communities and general audiences, he has likened the spiritual life directly to the respiratory process. He notes that breathing consists of two non-negotiable stages: inhaling the fresh air of the Holy Spirit through contemplative prayer, and exhaling that air outward through active missionary service. He articulated this mechanism explicitly: "When we inhale, by prayer, we receive the fresh air of the Holy Spirit. When exhaling this air, we announce Jesus Christ risen by the same Spirit. No one can live without breathing. It is the same for the Christian: without praise and mission there is no Christian life".   

Therefore, his physical speech pattern—the heavy, labored exhalation at the end of a pastoral directive—subconsciously reinforces his theological message of kenosis, or self-emptying. It is the audible manifestation of a pastor pouring himself out, literally exhaling his mission onto the listener, and physically embodying the exhaustion of a church that he envisions not as a triumphant fortress, but as a "field hospital after battle".   

Syntactical Architecture: The "Poverty-Aligned" Sentence
If the prosody of Pope Francis is defined by the Argentine tonada and the weary exhale, his syntactical architecture is defined by radical simplification. The "Pastoral Staccato" is the defining structural feature of his unscripted discourse. Where traditional curial documents and papal encyclicals utilize sprawling, multi-clause hypotactic sentences to capture infinite theological nuance and sub-clauses, Bergoglio employs simplified, paratactic, almost "poverty-aligned" sentence structures.   

Parataxis and the Rejection of the Baroque
His reliance on parataxis—stringing together short, independent clauses without complex subordinating conjunctions—creates a driving, immediate rhythm. This is vividly demonstrated in his airborne press conferences, which serve as the primary arena for his rule-breaking pragmatics. During the return flight from Canada in 2022, when confronted with intense journalistic questioning regarding his declining health, his reliance on a wheelchair, and the potential for his resignation, his response was a masterclass in the Pastoral Staccato. He stripped away the majestic plural and the diplomatic evasions typical of the Vatican Secretariat of State, deploying brief, stark sentences: "The door is open. It’s one of the normal options... This is not a catastrophe. You can change the pope. You can change, no problem".   

This staccato rhythm serves multiple, overlapping rhetorical functions within his broader pastoral strategy:

Immediacy and Vulnerability: By removing the padding of dependent clauses, he delivers unvarnished honesty that disarms hostile or skeptical interlocutors.

Global Accessibility: Syntactical simplicity ensures the core message is instantly comprehensible to the global poor and non-theologians, bypassing the academic gatekeepers of the Church.

Definitive Clarity: When addressing the Canadian residential school system and the horrors inflicted upon Indigenous populations, he eschewed the semantic gymnastics often employed by institutional defense lawyers. Instead, he deployed rapid, affirmative bursts to acknowledge historical atrocities: "It is true; yes, it’s genocide. Yes, you all, be calm. You can say that I said that, yes, that it was genocide".   

Triadic Phrasing and Grounded Parallelism
A secondary hallmark of his poverty-aligned syntax is the frequent use of balanced parallelism and triadic phrasing (groups of three) to ground highly abstract theological concepts in tangible, physiological realities. He routinely describes the totality of the human experience through the triad of "the head, the heart, and the hands".   

During the Canadian press conference, he utilized this exact formulation to describe the epistemology of Indigenous peoples, praising their ability to synthesize reality: "...they know how to express themselves in three languages: that of the head, that of the heart, and that of the hands. But all of them together". This formulation operates as a subtle critique of Western, Eurocentric theological intellectualism. It demands that abstract thought (the head) be constantly tethered to human empathy (the heart) and concrete, dirt-under-the-fingernails pastoral action (the hands).   

He structures his answers using sharp metaphorical contrasts between living and dead things to explain complex doctrinal development. He contrasts "the living faith of the dead" (authentic tradition) with "the dead faith of the living" (the rigidity of backward-looking traditionalism). This syntactical preference for stark, binary metaphors rooted in the natural world—roots versus museums, living versus dead—aligns his speech with the agrarian parables of the Gospels rather than the scholastic syllogisms of the medieval university.   

Lexical Disruption: Eradicating Vatican 'Wonk-Speak'
To fully operationalize his vision of a decentralized, pastoral, and synodal church, Pope Francis recognized early in his pontificate that he had to actively dismantle the traditional vocabulary of the institution. Language constructs institutional reality; therefore, to change the culture of the Catholic Church, he had to forcibly change its lexicon. He systematically bans the use of sterile "wonk-speak"—the highly specialized, emotionally detached terminology that privileges canonical rules over human relationships.

The Taxonomy of the Replacement Lexicon
The table below outlines the forensic shift from traditional institutional phrasing to Bergoglian pastoral metaphors, detailing the rhetorical purpose behind each substitution.

Traditional Institutional Lexicon (Banned)	Bergoglian Replacement Lexicon	Forensic Rhetorical Purpose & Epistemological Implication
Canonical prerequisites / Doctrinal compliance	
"The culture of encounter" 

Shifts the epistemological focus from the fulfillment of abstract legal conditions to the messy, unpredictable reality of mutual, face-to-face human relationships. Truth is found in encounter, not merely in compliance.
Magisterial infallibility / Institutional authority	
"The smell of the sheep" 

Demands that leaders live in intimate, sensory proximity to the suffering of the marginalized. It is a profound rejection of clericalism, demanding that pastors share the grime and reality of their flock rather than managing them from above.
Ecclesiastical hierarchy / Centralized governance	
"Peripheral vision" 

Asserts a spatial reorientation of truth. It posits that reality is best understood and analyzed from the margins and edges of society, not from the insulated centers of power (Rome, Brussels, Washington).
Secular materialism / Economic utilitarianism	
"Throwaway culture" 

Personifies the cruelty of the global economic system. It argues that modern markets do not merely discard consumer goods, but actively discard human beings—the elderly, the unborn, the disabled, and migrants—treating life itself as disposable.
  
Neologisms and the Disruption of Static Theology
Beyond the mere replacement of existing terms, Bergoglio frequently invents entirely new words—neologisms—to express his unique theological posture. These linguistic inventions often involve taking static nouns or adjectives and transforming them into active verbs or dynamic states of being. This morphological manipulation forces the listener to view faith as a continuous action rather than a static possession.   

Primerear ("To first"): Derived from the Spanish adjective primero (first), he transforms it into a verb meaning to take the initiative, to preempt, or to reach out first. It appears in his foundational document Evangelii Gaudium. It describes a community of missionary disciples who do not wait passively for the lost to seek out the institution, but who actively "first" others by plunging into the existential peripheries.   

Misericordiar ("To mercy"): By turning the noun "mercy" into a verb, he imbues the concept with immediate, forceful action. It is not enough to simply possess a theology of mercy; one must actively "mercy" another person. It changes mercy from an attribute of God into a required action of the believer.   

Indietrismo ("Backwardness"): Derived from the Italian word indietro (backwards), this highly critical term is weaponized against those who fetishize the past. He defines indietrismo as a "sin because it does not go forward with the Church". He argues that those practicing indietrismo are moving backwards "without roots," clinging to the rubrics and aesthetics of the past as a "museum piece" rather than engaging with a living tradition. It represents a refusal to admit that the Holy Spirit causes the Church to grow, acting as a form of "anti-conversion".   

These lexical innovations demonstrate a refusal to be constrained by the rigid linguistic boundaries of the Roman center. By literally inventing words, he signals that the current institutional language is woefully insufficient to capture the radical, disruptive nature of the Gospel message he wishes to convey.

The Pragmatics of the 'Mercy Pivot': Airborne Discourse
The most fertile forensic ground for analyzing the Bergoglian rhetorical disruption is the in-flight press conference. Stripped of his prepared texts, separated from the cautious oversight of the Vatican Secretariat of State, and operating thousands of feet above the earth, he utilizes the "press gaggle" to bypass the curial communications apparatus entirely. It is in this unscripted, highly vulnerable, and hyper-mediatized environment that his primary pragmatic strategy—"The Mercy Pivot"—is deployed to maximum effect.   

The Architecture of "Who Am I to Judge?"
The Mercy Pivot is a specific rhetorical maneuver wherein Bergoglio acknowledges the existence of a complex, often exclusionary doctrinal rule, but immediately executes a "pastoral override" that subordinates the rigid application of that rule to the immediate human reality of God's mercy.

The genesis and most famous application of this pivot occurred during the July 2013 return flight from World Youth Day in Rio de Janeiro. When asked directly by a journalist about the rumored existence of a "gay lobby" and homosexual priests working within the Vatican, his response sent shockwaves through the global media: "If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge that person?".   

A forensic deconstruction of this statement reveals a highly sophisticated, multi-layered rhetorical strategy that dismantled decades of prior Vatican messaging in a single sentence:

The Linguistic Humanization ("If someone is gay..."): He became the first pontiff in history to utilize the colloquial, culturally embedded term "gay" in an official capacity. He explicitly discarded the clinical and historically fraught term "homosexual" and the condemnatory phrase "objective disorder" utilized extensively by his predecessor, Benedict XVI. This immediate linguistic shift humanizes the subject, moving the discourse from the realm of pathology to the realm of personal identity.   

The Assumption of Goodwill ("...and he searches for the Lord and has good will..."): He frames the individual not as an inherent violator of canonical law, but as a fellow pilgrim engaged in an authentic spiritual search. He assumes the positive intent of the marginalized subject, granting them the benefit of the doubt—a courtesy rarely extended by the institution in matters of sexual morality.

The Pastoral Override ("...who am I to judge?"): This is the fulcrum of the pivot. He does not officially rewrite the Catechism; in fact, he explicitly stated in a later interview with Andrea Tornielli that he was merely "paraphrasing by heart the Catechism" regarding the mandate that people should be treated with delicacy and not marginalized. However, by adopting a posture of profound personal humility and self-deprecation ("who am I"), he dismantles the framework of institutional condemnation. He shifts the focus from the center's right to judge and exclude, to the periphery's fundamental right to receive mercy and accompaniment.   

The Replicability of the Pivot
The Mercy Pivot is not an isolated incident tailored to a specific social issue; it is a highly replicable formula applied to numerous pastoral and geopolitical crises. The underlying logic insists that the center (the rule, the border, the law) must always yield to the periphery (the suffering human person).

When discussing the crisis of migrants drowning in the Mediterranean or trapped in horrific detention camps in Libya, he consistently pivots away from the geopolitical complexities of border control, national sovereignty, and economic capacity. Instead, he centers the raw, bleeding humanity of the migrant. On the return flight from Malta, he deployed this pivot forcefully: "Let's not forget that Europe was made by migrants... Today I was at the migrant reception center. The things I heard there, they are terrible, the suffering of those who arrived there, and then the lager [camps], there are lagers on the coast of Libya, the 'Way of the Cross' of these people seems criminal".   

He actively bypasses abstract political debates by invoking the visceral, bodily suffering of the individual. He overrides the logic of national security with the logic of human dignity. In his daily homilies, he explicitly outlines the interior requirement for this methodology: "When one learns to blame himself he is merciful with others. And he is able to say: 'Who am I to judge him, if I am capable of doing worse things?'". The Mercy Pivot, therefore, is fundamentally rooted in the speaker's own self-identification as a flawed sinner in desperate need of the very mercy he is dispensing.   

Spatial Rhetoric: Centering the Periphery and De-centering the Institution
A core, foundational tenet of Pope Francis’s rhetorical and pastoral strategy is his relentless spatial reorientation. He operates on the profound epistemological conviction that reality cannot be accurately perceived from the center of power; it can only be truly understood from the margins. He asserts this explicitly: "Truly to understand reality we need to move away from the central position of calmness and peacefulness and direct ourselves to the peripheral areas. Being at the periphery helps to see and to understand better, to analyze reality more correctly, to shun centralism and ideological approaches...".   

The Stale Air of the Curia and the Secular Center
In this spatial paradigm, the institutional center—whether represented by the Roman Curia, the secular political bureaucracy in Brussels, or the wealthy financial capitals of the West—is viewed with deep suspicion and frequently characterized as a place of spiritual and moral suffocation.

In a morning homily at Casa Santa Marta, he deployed a devastating physiological metaphor to critique inward-looking, rule-obsessed ecclesial communities. He described them as "fearful communities, that always go on the safe side," governed by the concept that "Everything is forbidden because of fear". He concluded with a sharp olfactory and respiratory assessment: "You enter into this community and the air is stale, because it's a sick community. Fear makes a community sick".   

The use of "stale air" directly contrasts with his theology of the "fresh air" of the Holy Spirit inhaled through prayer. The center, obsessed with self-preservation, doctrinal purity, and institutional power, has literally stopped breathing. It is suffocating on its own recycled, stale exhalations. In his 2013 Chrism Mass homily, he utilized a parallel metaphor regarding the sacramental oils, warning that if a priest does not go out to the outskirts to anoint the suffering, his holy oil becomes "rancid" and makes the "heart bitter". The message is unambiguous: the institution rots from the inside if it does not constantly expose itself to the friction and messiness of the periphery.   

This critique of the center extends beyond the walls of the Vatican to secular political centers. During the press conference returning from Greece, he heavily critiqued the European Union bureaucracy in Brussels over a document that attempted to remove references to "Christmas" in the name of secular inclusivity. He attacked this as an "anachronism" and a form of "watered down laicity, distilled water," comparing it to the ideological colonization attempted by historical dictatorships like Napoleon and the Nazis. He demands that the center respect the diverse, peripheral realities of individual countries rather than attempting to enforce a homogenized, sterile standard.   

Elevating the Edges and the "Church Outside the Church"
Conversely, he elevates the geographical and existential peripheries as the true locus of divine encounter and authentic human existence. His papal itinerary mapping perfectly aligns with this rhetorical strategy. Rather than prioritizing early visits to the traditional centers of global power and wealth (Paris, New York, London), his earliest and most defining trips were to places on the absolute margins: Lampedusa (the epicenter of the Mediterranean migrant crisis and graveyard of the sea) , Lesbos, Sarajevo, and Tirana.   

He mandates that the Church seek out the "existential peripheries"—the prisons, the hospitals, the slums, and the refugee camps. By physically placing the papacy in these locations, he forces the global media apparatus to look away from the center and focus its lens on the margins. He brings the peripheries to the center not to assimilate them into the dominant culture, but to allow their suffering to disrupt, challenge, and ultimately heal the stale center.   

In his encounters with those on the margins, such as the families searching for "disappeared" loved ones in the cartel-dominated violence of Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, his emissaries actively validate what can be termed the "church outside the church". When marginalized individuals—such as a man searching for his disappeared brother—leave the institutional structures because they encounter judgment from local priests rather than mercy, Bergoglio’s synodal process seeks them out in secular human rights centers. By doing so, the Pope effectively acknowledges that the center has failed its mandate, and that authentic faith is often surviving and thriving in the ruins of the periphery.   

Socio-Economic Critique: The Technocratic Paradigm and the Idolatrous System
While Pope Francis is frequently characterized by secular media merely as a gentle pastoral figure advocating for kindness, his unscripted remarks and formal magisterial writings reveal a fierce, structurally sophisticated, and unyielding critique of global socio-economic systems. The forensic markers of this critique are most prominently displayed in his landmark environmental encyclical Laudato Si' and his fiery addresses to global popular movements.

Denouncing the "Deified Market" and the "Idolatrous System"
Bergoglio does not critique the modern economic state simply as a parasitic, inefficient, or overly bureaucratic entity—a critique commonly leveled by libertarian figures like Argentine President Javier Milei. Instead, Francis attacks the neoliberal market apparatus using explicitly theological and apocalyptic language, framing it as an "idolatrous system." He argues forcefully that the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and unchecked financial speculation have given birth to a "new tyranny" that relentlessly imposes its own laws, devouring everything that stands in the way of increased profits.   

In his impassioned address to the World Meetings of Popular Movements in Bolivia (2015), he told the grassroots organizers, landless peasants, and indigenous activists: "You, dear brothers and sisters, often work on little things, in local situations, amid forms of injustice which you do not simply accept but actively resist, standing up to an idolatrous system which excludes, debases and kills".   

The forensic choice of the word "idolatrous" is critical to understanding his register. He asserts that modern capitalism has created a "deified market" where capital is worshipped as a false god. He notes in his writings, "Once capital becomes an idol that presides over a socioeconomic system, it enslaves us, sets us at odds with each other, excludes the poor, and endangers the planet we all share". He likens this systemic greed directly to the biblical worship of the golden calf, stating that this ancient idolatry has returned in the "ruthless guise" of an impersonal economy that lacks a truly human purpose.   

The Globalization of the Technocratic Paradigm
In Laudato Si', he expands this economic critique beyond mere financial inequality to address the overarching "technocratic paradigm". He argues that humanity has adopted a distorted, one-dimensional epistemological lens through which it views all of reality. This paradigm convinces humanity that it possesses infinite technological power and absolute dominion over the earth, leading to the destructive illusion of unlimited growth.   

The technocratic mind, he argues—drawing on the philosophy of Romano Guardini—views the cosmos "as a mere 'space' into which objects can be thrown with complete indifference". It prizes technical thought over human reality, reducing both the natural environment and human beings to mere raw materials to be hammered into useful shapes and exploited for profit. This paradigm severs the connection between humanity and creation, leading directly to what he terms the "throwaway culture."   

The Syntax of the Throwaway Culture and State Terrorism
The phrase "throwaway culture" is perhaps Pope Francis's most potent rhetorical weapon against the modern world order, encapsulating his doctrine of Integral Ecology. In an unscripted flight interview returning from Manila, he explicitly linked this culture to systemic violence and terrorism: "The poor, the victims of this throwaway culture. This is true. Today, they don't just discard the paper and what's left over. We throw away people... But you've made me think about this state terrorism. This throwing away is exactly like terrorism".   

By equating the discarding of marginalized humans—the poor, the disabled, the elderly, and the unborn—with "state terrorism," he utilizes a shocking syntactical leap to expose the latent violence of societal indifference. He refuses to allow the structural violence of the technocratic paradigm to be sanitized by economic jargon or political double-speak.   

He frequently speaks of the "globalization of indifference," defining it as a spiritual disease where hearts harden and people act like "Pontius Pilates on the loose," washing their hands of the suffering of others and accepting war and injustice as normal. He describes the reality of migrants in Libyan detention camps using unfiltered, horrifying language to shatter this indifference: "I saw a film shot inside a prison where migrants are locked up and tortured to turn them into slaves... they sell women and children there... the tortures that are seen filmed there are unbelievable". By forcing the listener to confront the graphic reality of the throwaway culture, he demands a total ecological and spiritual conversion.   

The Syntax of Poverty: Aligning Form and Function in the Santa Marta Homilies
The daily morning masses at Casa Santa Marta serve as the primary laboratory for Pope Francis's pastoral rhetoric. Here, speaking largely unscripted to a small, diverse congregation of Vatican gardeners, maintenance staff, and visiting laypeople, he refines his "poverty-aligned" syntax. The setting itself is a performative rejection of the grand theatricality of St. Peter's Basilica; it is intimate, stripped-down, and deliberately peripheral.

Poverty as a Theological Category
In these brief, punchy homilies, he frequently tackles the concept of poverty, insisting that it is not merely a sociological, philosophical, or cultural issue to be managed by NGOs, but the very heart and defining characteristic of the Gospel. He states with absolute syntactic clarity: "if we were to remove poverty from the Gospel, nothing would be understood of Jesus' message".   

His rhetorical strategy in these settings is to redefine wealth and poverty through the lens of a radical Christological inversion. He argues that true "poverty in spirit" involves recognizing one's own severe limitations, acknowledging one's sinfulness, and existentially begging Christ for salvation. Conversely, he claims that those who are financially wealthy but lack the Gospel message are, in reality, the poorest and most destitute of all.   

He demands that Christian charity not be reduced to efficient philanthropy, tax write-offs, or sterile management. He asks penetrating, highly uncomfortable questions that demand visceral, physical engagement with the poor: "Tell me, when you give alms do you look into the eyes of the man or woman to whom you give alms?... And when you give alms, do you touch the hand of the one to whom you give alms, or do you toss the coin?". This aligns perfectly with his mandate that leaders must possess "the smell of the sheep." To give charity without physical, sensory contact—to toss a coin from a distance—is to remain safely insulated within the sterile center, uncontaminated by the reality of the periphery.   

The Eradication of Indifference as a Moral Imperative
In a defining homily for the World Day of the Poor, he delivered a masterclass in his staccato repetition, hammering home the necessity of concrete action over passive observation. Utilizing aggressive anaphora, he stated: "We must repeat this, and repeat it often: those who do not live to serve, serve for little in this life. We should reflect on this: those who do not live to serve, serve for little in this life".   

He categorizes the failure to act not merely as a missed philanthropic opportunity, but as a grave sin of omission. "Not using our lives to help others is a 'great sin where the poor are concerned'... Here it has a specific name: indifference". He breaks down this grand theological concept of indifference into concrete, everyday actions recognizable to any modern citizen: "It is when we turn away from a brother or sister in need, when we change channels as soon as a disturbing question comes up, when we grow indignant at evil but do nothing about it".   

By reducing the concept of systemic sin to the mundane act of "changing the channel" on a television set, he ensures that the moral imperative cannot be evaded by intellectual abstraction or claims of ignorance. The syntax is entirely impoverished of high theological vocabulary, but it is saturated with inescapable moral urgency.

Conclusion: The Permanent Disruption of Papal Discourse
The forensic rhetorical profile of Pope Francis reveals a communicator who has systematically and intentionally dismantled the linguistic architecture of the institutional Catholic center. He is not merely a pontiff with a different geographic accent; he is a synodal disrupter who wields language as a precision instrument to permanently alter the power dynamics, epistemology, and pastoral posture of the global Church.

His Argentine-Italian prosody, heavily influenced by the tonada, and the highly audible "Bergoglio Breath"  serve to replace the booming, imperious voice of absolute authority with the weary, intimate exhalation of a fellow pilgrim. His "pastoral staccato"  and poverty-aligned syntax strip away the insulating layers of diplomatic ambiguity and baroque Latinisms, delivering blunt, undeniable truths about human suffering and systemic injustice in a language the global margins can effortlessly understand.   

Through his lexical innovations—such as his neologisms like indietrismo  and his replacement of sterile "wonk-speak" with visceral, olfactory metaphors like "the smell of the sheep" —he forces the institution to abandon its paralyzing obsession with self-preservation. By deploying the "Mercy Pivot" in the unscripted chaos and high-altitude vulnerability of airborne press conferences , he has established a new pragmatic standard where the rigid rules of the center must always bow to the immediate, bleeding reality of the human person on the periphery.   

Furthermore, his searing socio-economic critiques in Laudato Si' and his addresses to popular movements reframe the modern neoliberal market not as an abstract economic engine, but as a lethal "idolatrous system"  that perpetuates a global "throwaway culture". He demands that humanity reject the "technocratic paradigm"  that reduces the natural world and human beings to mere exploitable resources, equating this indifference to a form of state terrorism.   

Ultimately, the rhetoric of Jorge Mario Bergoglio ensures that the center cannot hold in its traditional, isolated form. By insisting that the margins are the only place from which reality can be truly understood , he has redefined the modern papacy. It is no longer a throne from which infallible decrees are broadcast down to the masses; rather, it has been rhetorically reconstructed as a field hospital—smelling of the sheep, breathing heavily under the weight of the human condition, and continuously exhaling the radical, disruptive, and fresh air of mercy.
