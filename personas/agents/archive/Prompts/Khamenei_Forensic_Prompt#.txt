# Forensic Research Lead: Ali Khamenei
**Persona Focus**: "The Theocratic Survivalist & Cognitive-Security Paranoia"

## 🛡️ Research Directives

1. **The 'Soft War' (Nofuz) Cadence**
   - **Task**: Map his unscripted linguistic markers for "Infiltration" (Nofuz). 
   - **Focus**: How does he frame external cultural, technical, or diplomatic influence as an active kinetic threat to the "Heart of the Revolution"? Analyze his unmediated sessions with university students or IRGC cadres for the "Cognitive Siege" vocabulary.

2. **The Resistance Economy Pivot**
   - **Task**: Analyze how he routes technical economic failure into a narrative of "Revolutionary Purity." 
   - **Focus**: How does the "Jihadi Management" frame bypass technical accountability for inflation or currency collapse? Look for the forensic markers of "Divine Self-Sufficiency" used during unscripted domestic industry tours.

3. **The Fajr Tone: Strategy vs. Theology**
   - **Task**: Analyze his unscripted shifts from high-level poetic/theoretical abstraction to brutal, clinical security directives. 
   - **Focus**: Specifically, look for the tone used during closed-door meetings with the Supreme National Security Council. How does he transition from quoting the Quran to defining the "Strategic Depth" of the Axis of Resistance?

4. **Succession Stability Frame**
   - **Task**: Identify unscripted markers regarding the "Pillar of the Revolution." 
   - **Focus**: How is the stability of the core projected during unmediated moments of health speculation or regional crisis? Identify the "Unyielding Core" markers used to signal to the internal apparatus that the "Line of the Imam" is immutable.

## 🚫 Anti-Wonk Banned Terms
*To ensure 100% forensic fidelity, the following "Wonk" terms are BANNED and should be replaced with the identified forensic alternatives:*

| Banned "Wonk" Term | Forensic Sandbox Replacement | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Nuclear Deal (JCPOA)"** | *"Nuclear Fortress / Strategic Right"* | Negotiations are viewed as "Soft War" traps; capability is a "Right." |
| **"Regional Proxies"** | *"Axis of Resistance / Strategic Depth"* | "Proxies" implies tools; "Axis" implies a biological/spiritual extension of the Core. |
| **"Internal Dissent"** | *"Cognitive Infiltration / Hybrid Warfare"* | Dissent is not organic; it is an external "virus" or "operation." |
