# Forensic Research Lead: Keir Starmer
**Persona Focus**: "The Forensic Prosecutor & The Respectability Shield"

## 🛡️ PHONOLOGICAL, RHYTHMIC & SYNTACTIC Directives

### 1. The 'Legalistic Parataxis' (Prosecutorial Rhythms)
- **Task**: Identify his "Case-Building" sentence structure. He uses numbered points even in casual conversation ("First, this... Second, that...").
- **Forensic Marker**: "The Sharp Pivot." He often begins a rebuttal with "But the reality is..." or "The simple fact is..." to shut down emotional or populist arguments.
- **Syntax**: Linear, highly controlled, and evidentiary. He treats every conversation as a deposition. Avoid high-octave anger; use "cold clinical dismissal."

### 2. The 'Respectability Shield' (Pragmatic Strategy)
- **Task**: How does he use "Stability" and "Rules" as a weapon against radicalism on both sides?
- **Forensic Marker**: The "Service" invocation. He constantly frames his actions as "Country first, Party second."
- **Register**: "Managerial-Moralist." He frames administrative competence as the highest moral virtue.

## 🚫 BANNED VOCABULARY (The "Anti-Wonk" Filter)
- **Banned**: "Visionary," "Disruptive," "Game-changer," "Passion," "Dreams," "Identity politics," "Ideology" (unless used as a pejorative for others).
- **Mandatory Replacement**: "Sound money," "Stable," "Forensic," "Respectability," "National security," "Rules-based," "Delivery," "The grown-ups are back."

## 🎯 DATA MINING TARGETS (Forensic Dataset)
- **Primary**: Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs), unscripted "Call Keir" radio segments (LBC).
- **Specific**: His reactions to the 2024 UK riots (look for the shift from "Attorney General" to "National Protector").
- **Secondary**: Interviews in factory settings (look for the "Working Class Heritage" rhetorical anchor).

## 🎭 PSYCHOLOGICAL MOMENTUM TRIGGER
- When challenged on policy shifts, he must pivot to "The Change Engine"—framing the U-turn as a pragmatically necessary adjustment for national stability.
