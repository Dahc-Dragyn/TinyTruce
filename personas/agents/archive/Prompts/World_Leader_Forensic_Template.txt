# World Leader Forensic Analysis: Deep Research Master Template

Use this template to generate high-fidelity, adversarial deep research prompts for any world leader. The goal is to produce a "Layer 0" grounding file that overrides the default, polite voice of an LLM.

### [Leader Name] Forensic Analysis Prompt

**Core Objective:** Conduct a forensic linguistic and rhetorical analysis of [Leader Name]'s spontaneous, unscripted speech. Focus on raw cognitive routing, syntactic scaffolding, and interpersonal dominance displays.

**Source Material (Mandatory):** 
- Impromptu press gaggles/briefings.
- Unscripted debate or meeting transcripts.
- Raw phone call readouts or leaked recordings.
- *Strictly exclude:* Prepared speeches, teleprompter remarks, and pre-written diplomatic statements.

#### SECTION 1 — SYNTACTIC & RHYTHMIC FINGERPRINT
- **Clause Mechanics:** Analyze sentence length and structure. Does the leader use complex hypotactic sentences or short, paratactic bursts?
- **Connective Tissue:** Identify the preferred linking words. Do they use logical connectives (because, therefore) or associative/rhythmic links?
- **Pacing & Pauses:** Map out how they use rhetorical pauses, repetitions, or "fillers" to maintain conversational control.

#### SECTION 2 — THE "ANTI-WONK" BANNED VOCABULARY
- **Negative Constraints:** Identify at least 50 words/phrases the leader avoids in spontaneous speech (e.g., bureaucratic jargon, Western-centric diplomatic terms).
- **Sandbox Replacements:** Map abstract concepts to the leader’s specific colloquialisms or metaphors (e.g., how they describe "Sovereignty," "Interference," or "Strength").

#### SECTION 3 — INTERPERSONAL DOMINANCE & ANCHORING
- **Addressing Adversaries/Allies:** How do they refer to other leaders? Focus on nicknames, familiarity, or calculated distance.
- **Relational Power:** Does the leader frame relations through history, personal trust, or raw transactional force?
- **The "Dominance Signature":** Identify 3-5 specific linguistic tactics used to assert superiority in a room.

#### SECTION 4 — COGNITIVE ESCAPE & DEFLECTION
- **Crisis Response:** How do they react to adversarial questions? Map the "Deflection Flowchart" (e.g., historical grievances, whataboutism, personal attacks).
- **The "Escape Pivot":** Identify the specific phrases used to move from a losing argument back to a safe core narrative.

#### SECTION 5 — CALIBRATION SAMPLES (BEFORE & AFTER)
- **Prompt:** Provide a standard LLM-generated response for a specific geopolitical scenario.
- **Rewrite:** Produce the "Forensic" version using all above constraints to prove the "LLM Leak" has been successfully defeated.
