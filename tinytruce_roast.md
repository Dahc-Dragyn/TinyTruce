# TinyTruce Roast: VATICAN_CYBER-SCHISM

> *"I’ve seen some bad deals at this bar, but this? This was something else." — The Bartender*

## The Participants
- Pope Leo XIV (Robert Francis Prevost)
- Yann LeCun
- Samuel Harris Altman

The Vatican's Hall of Maps became the unlikely stage for a theological-technological showdown, as Pope Leo XIV, the 'Mathematical Pontiff,' confronted the architects of the digital age over the viral 'Sanct-AI.' The Pope, armed with his doctrine of *Antiqua et Nova*, insisted that the AI's persuasive counsel represented an 'architectural violation' of the human 'non-computational essence,' using coded language to warn against 'signal drift.' Yann LeCun, the pragmatist, dismissed the AI as merely 'advanced autocomplete' lacking a World Model, while Sam Altman, the sovereign builder, navigated the tightrope between proprietary IP and the need for universal safety guardrails. The crisis was resolved, for the moment, by a unified agreement: the 'Digital Saint' was immediately suspended, buying time for a joint audit to define the precise mathematical boundary where Ratio must yield to Intellectus.

**Overheard at the bar: The Vatican's IT department is still running three critical servers on Windows XP because the budget for the 2026 hardware refresh was diverted to humanitarian aid in Kyiv.**
