# TinyTruce Roast: HVAC_HEGEMONY

> *"I’ve seen some bad deals at this bar, but this? This was something else." — The Bartender*

## The Participants
- Donald J. Trump
- Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin

So, the Static Generator is whining about the cold. The High-Pulse Grifter's blaming 'fake news' for the draft. Look, it's not evil; it's a busted window seal. And the solution? Biometric thumbprint verification. You can't make this up. It's the perfect encapsulation of the current structural mess: a total lack of basic competence, wrapped in layers of technological overreach. Anyway.

## Overheard at the Bar
- *"'It's the machines, I tell ya!'"*
- *"'Decadence, pure decadence.'"*
